This repo includes all the apps I made during my advanced Android Application Course. 

## 1. Session01_F23ApiDemok
In this application, I've made an Android app that fetches API data.

## 2. App Permission App
In this application, I made an Android app that takes permission from the user for location, microphone, and camera.

## 3. My Camera App
In this application, I made an Android app that takes permission from the user for a camera and allows users to take pictures and store them in the device gallery (storage).
